# AirlineManagementSystem
This is an Airline Management System  based on cpp and its data structures and algorithms


This is a simple command-line travel management system that allows users to log in, register, view cities, book tickets, and check their booking history. The system uses a modified Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the minimum fare between cities based on a hardcoded cost matrix. It also handles user authentication and ticket booking with file storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in, register new accounts, and store user credentials.
- **City Information**: Displays a list of cities and allows users to select source and destination cities.
- **Ticket Booking**: Enables users to book tickets between cities with a calculated fare.
- **Booking History**: Users can view their booking history.

## Technologies Used

- C++ for implementing the core logic.
- Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest path and minimum fare.
- File handling for user credentials and booking history storage.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, or similar).
- Basic understanding of C++ and Bellman-Ford algorithm.
